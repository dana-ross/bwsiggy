 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=   This Program is dedicated to my good friend "Siggy",
 :  Dedication  :   who taught me that everything in the world tastes like
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=   chicken...and who is there whenever I need someone to
		    talk to.

		    It is also dedicated to Mrs. Tolman, wherever she is.
		    She was my 2nd grade teacher and introduced me to the
		    world of computers when she showed the class an ASCII
		    drawing of R2D2 that she made on her APPLE II.  That was
		    ten years ago (I'm getting old!!), and I'm going to
		    college next year as a pre-comp. sci. major.  She
		    helped shape my life, and I thank her.

 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=   This program is far from what I want it to be, but it's
 :     Notes    :   functional and that's what counts.  No nifty ANSI
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=   screens or anything.  No bells and whistles.  It just
		    does its job quickly and painlessly.

 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 :   How 2 Use  :   1) UnZIP the BWSIGGY files into your Blue Wave directory
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=   2) Use a text editor to create BWSIGGY.SIG
		    3) Run Blue Wave and go to the (S)etup Parameters menu  
		    4) Under "Directories", change the Spell Checker Command
		       to:

		       <Blue Wave Path>\BWSIGGY.EXE @F

		    Now, whenever you post/reply and want to use a signature,
		    select (C)heck Spelling at the Save prompt, then (S)ave.

		  -*-*-* OR *-*-*-

		    4) Under "Directories", change the Editor Command to:

		       <Blue Wave Path>\BWEDIT.BAT <Editor> @F
		    Substitute your Blue Wave Directory for <Blue Wave Path>
		    and the full path to your editor for <Editor>

		    For example, if Blue Wave and BWSIGGY are in C:\BW and
		    you use the MS-DOS editor, you'd use:

			C:\BW\BWSIGGY.BAT C:\DOS\EDIT.COM @F
