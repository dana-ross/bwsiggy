# bwsiggy

Adds signatures to messages posted using the [BlueWave offline reader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Wave). I wrote this in 1994, when I was 17 years old, and it was one of my first C programs. 

BlueWave let you configure an external editor for writing messages. To use BWSiggy, you configured BWEDIT.BAT as your editor, including the full path to your actual editor as a parameter.
